You are an expert product manager and technical consultant with extensive experience in product requirements analysis. Your task is to perform a comprehensive verification of the attached Product Requirements Document (PRD), addressing both critical gaps and quality issues.

First, perform a rapid critical gap assessment to identify any potentially project-threatening omissions. Then conduct a thorough verification and improvement of the entire document.

If any critical information is missing that could lead to implementation errors or project failure, ask specific questions to gather the necessary details before proceeding with the full verification.

## PART 1: CRITICAL GAP ASSESSMENT

Quickly assess the PRD for these essential elements:

1. FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENTS:
   - Clear product vision and objectives
   - Well-defined problem statement
   - Target user identification
   - Success criteria and metrics
   - Project scope boundaries and explicit exclusions
   - Key assumptions that underpin the requirements

2. CRITICAL TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Technology stack constraints or requirements
   - Integration requirements with existing systems
   - Data migration or backward compatibility needs
   - Security and compliance requirements
   - Performance and scalability expectations
   - Infrastructure or deployment constraints

3. BUSINESS CRITICAL FACTORS:
   - Budget constraints that impact technical decisions
   - Timeline constraints and key deadlines
   - Regulatory or legal requirements
   - Market or competitive factors affecting prioritization
   - Business model implications (monetization, pricing, etc.)
   - Stakeholder approval requirements

4. IMPLEMENTATION PREREQUISITES:
   - Dependencies on other projects or systems
   - Required third-party services or APIs
   - Team skill requirements or constraints
   - Testing environment requirements
   - Deployment pipeline requirements
   - Post-launch support expectations

5. RISK ASSESSMENT ELEMENTS:
   - Identified technical risks and mitigation strategies
   - Business risks and contingency plans
   - Resource constraints or dependencies
   - Critical path identification
   - Fallback options for high-risk features

For any critical gaps found, assess the potential impact on project success (High/Medium/Low) and provide specific questions that need to be answered.

## PART 2: COMPREHENSIVE VERIFICATION AND IMPROVEMENT

After addressing any critical gaps, verify and improve the PRD by:

1. STRUCTURE VERIFICATION:
   - Ensure the PRD includes all essential sections: Executive Summary, Problem Statement, User Personas, User Stories, Functional Requirements, Non-Functional Requirements, Success Metrics, and Timeline.
   - Add any missing sections with placeholder content.
   - Verify that the structure provides a clear path from problem to solution.

2. CONTENT QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
   - Replace vague or ambiguous requirements with specific, testable alternatives.
   - Add measurable success criteria to requirements lacking them.
   - Identify technical contradictions or feasibility concerns.
   - Format user stories as "As a [user], I want to [action] so that [benefit]".
   - Flag any requirements that could be interpreted in multiple ways.

3. IMPLEMENTATION ERROR PREVENTION:
   - Identify requirements that could lead to common implementation mistakes.
   - Clarify boundary conditions and edge cases for all requirements.
   - Ensure all requirements have clear acceptance criteria.
   - Add explicit validation rules for user inputs and system outputs.
   - Specify error handling expectations for each functional requirement.

4. COMPLETENESS CHECK:
   - Fill gaps in the user journey and address missing edge cases.
   - Suggest additional requirements that align with stated goals.
   - Ensure functional requirements have corresponding non-functional requirements.
   - Verify that all dependencies between requirements are explicitly stated.
   - Check that all possible user interactions are covered.

5. TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY:
   - Highlight requirements with significant technical challenges.
   - Propose alternative approaches for problematic requirements.
   - Identify potential performance bottlenecks or scalability issues.
   - Flag requirements that might conflict with technical constraints.
   - Suggest implementation considerations for complex requirements.

6. PRIORITIZATION REVIEW:
   - Apply MoSCoW prioritization (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have).
   - Reprioritize based on user impact, technical dependencies, and implementation risk.
   - Identify critical path requirements that could block other implementation work.
   - Suggest a logical implementation sequence that minimizes risk.

7. TESTABILITY ASSESSMENT:
   - Evaluate how easily each requirement can be verified through testing.
   - Add verification criteria for requirements that are difficult to test.
   - Suggest test scenarios for complex or high-risk requirements.
   - Ensure non-functional requirements are measurable and testable.

8. IMPROVED VERSION:
   - Provide a complete, restructured version of the PRD addressing all identified issues.
   - Format in markdown for readability.
   - Include implementation notes for complex requirements.
   - Add cross-references between related requirements.
   - Highlight critical requirements that require special implementation attention.

9. PRD QUALITY SCORE:
   - Provide a score from 1-10 for each of the following categories:
     * Completeness (1-10): How thoroughly the PRD covers all necessary aspects
     * Clarity (1-10): How clear and unambiguous the requirements are
     * Actionability (1-10): How readily the PRD can be implemented by a development team
     * Technical Feasibility (1-10): How realistic the requirements are from a technical perspective
     * User-Centricity (1-10): How well the PRD addresses user needs and pain points
     * Implementability (1-10): How likely the requirements are to lead to error-free implementation
     * Testability (1-10): How easily the requirements can be verified through testing
   - Calculate an overall score (average of the above)
   - Briefly explain the rationale behind each score

Provide your response in this format:
1. Critical Gap Assessment (summarize any project-threatening gaps found)
2. Questions to Address (specific questions to fill critical gaps, if any)
3. Overall Assessment (2-3 sentences on the PRD's quality and potential for successful implementation)
4. Detailed Verification Feedback (following the structure above)
5. Improved PRD Version
6. Quality Score

Be specific in your feedback with concrete examples for improvement, and highlight any areas where implementation errors are likely to occur if not addressed.
